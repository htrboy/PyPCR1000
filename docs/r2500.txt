ICOM IC-R2500/PCR-2500 PROTOCOL

==================================================

ICOM PCR-1500/2500 Command Set:

Frequency: K0GMMMKKKHHHmmff00
where K0 G MMM KKK HHH mm ff 00
G=GHz
MMM=MHz
KKK=KHz
HHH=Hz
mm = mode
ff = Filter
00 = Padding Bytes (always there)

Mode Settings:
00 = LSB
01 = USB
02 = AM
03 = CW
04 = Not used or Unknown
05 = NFM
06 = WFM
07 = DSTAR (PCR-2500 Only)
08 = P25 (PCR-2500 Only)

Filter Settings:
00 = 3 Khz (actually 2.8 Khz) (CW USB LSB AM)
01 = 6 Khz (CW USB LSB AM NFM)
02 = 15 Khz (AM NFM)
03 = 50 Khz (AM NFM WFM)
04 = 230 Khz (WFM)

If the command is good you should get a G000 back.
I got G001 when I tried modes above 6 which means bad command.


The memory file is CSV but uses FM and P25 for the mode entries.

Inquire signal information. These commands can be Polled or are
returned as a packet if Autoupdate is ON (See G301) and one of the
values changes.

I0? Squelch Status: returns 04 = Closed, 07 = Open

J8001|J8101|J820F|J8301 <- The pipes are there only for visual reference.

On startup the software sends GD?
Returns GD00 if NO DSP installed
Returns GD01 if DSP Installed

Autoupdate must be ON (send G301 + cr + lf):

J8001 Always the same

J81xx DSP Power (UT-106)

xx is 01=D.SQL (NAC FILTER) ON: Allow ANY NAC,TGID or UNIT ID through
xx is 02=D.SQL (NAC FILTER) ON: ALL Stored filter values are used.
You should now explicity set them (see JB2x/3x/4x)

JB2xxxx is the P25 NAC value, when D.SQL is enabled

JB3xxxx is the TGID Filter/Mask, when D.SQL is enabled

K2xxxxxxx PROGram Scan Quick Tune (Rcvr1),
K3xxxxxxx PROGram Scan Quick Tune (Rcvr2):
This means that the radio expects abbreviated freq tunning (See
K2/3xxxxxxxx) instructions from the s/w
to help speed up the scanning process.
Every tune message (K2/3xxxxxxxx where Xs=HEX) must be followed by an
H897/HC91 "execute" instruction.
This allows the s/w to set SQL/DSP params prior to using the H9/HC "execute"
instruction.
The radio will then tune to the freq and return H9/C02, then H9/C01. These
two response values back-to-
back mean that this freq did not contain a carrier, and is expecting the
next freq to be sent.
If there was a carrier, then the normal Ixxx signal strength value would
have been returned.
Scanning should stop at this point until carrrier is lost, then resume.
** Expected responses are H9xx=Rcvr1 and HDxx=Rcvr2.
